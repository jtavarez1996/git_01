## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make. 
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

“Will you walk into my parlour?” said the Spider to the Fly,  
“‘Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy;  
The way into my parlour is up a winding stair,  
And I have many curious things to shew when you are there.”  
“Oh no, no,” said the little Fly, “to ask me is in vain,  
For who goes up your winding stair can ne’er come down again.”  

“I’m sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;  
Will you rest upon my little bed?” said the Spider to the Fly.
